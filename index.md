## From @jhinks#2709
in about 5 days time (rough estimate) the server info will change, this is because of a hardware change which should fix the bedrock dcing problem. I will change the server MOTD to alert players outside of the discord but if you know anyone who isnâ€™t here be sure to alert them. This is your warning for it
