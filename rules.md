# Vitae Earth Rules and Guidelines 

## Use of Hacks, mods and in-game exploits
1.1 - The use of hacked clients, macros, or any mods that give a player an unfair advantage are not allowed. Being found using a hacked client with malicious intent is a 30d, then permanent ban. The use of a hacked client non-maliciously will result in a 10d. The use of exploits will result in a 10d ban.
Note that this excludes the following:
Optifine or other mods to improve performance
Minimap addons unless they show more info than the Dynmap
Any mods that are purely aesthetic (texture packs)
Schematic mods unless they have a printer function
Clients such as Badlion or Lunar client
1.2 - being found to know about someone who is hacking or exploiting, and is benefiting from them also without alerting an admin will result in the same punishment as the person committing the offence. If you find out someone is hacking please open a support ticket in the discord using “ModMail”
1.3 - intentional server crashing will result in a permanent ban. Accidental crashing of the server may also result in a temp. ban.

## Behavior in-game and in chat
2.1 - use of inappropriate language and sending NSFW messages. Both in the discord and in-game the use of slurs that are towards minority groups is an immediate and permanent ban. We do not tolerate that kind of behaviour here. You may also be banned/ muted for sending NSFW imagery or messages, as we want to keep this  a safe space for everyone.
2.2 - in chats try to stick to using English, however over PM’s and by using /w, any language is allowed.
2.3.1 - Spam in the discord. messages that are flagged by a bot or staff member as spam will result in an infraction. If during a 1 hour period, 3 infractions are received, then you are rewarded with a 1 hour mute.
2.3.2 - spam in the Server. If you are deemed by an admin as spamming, meaning that your messages disrupt chat, then you will receive a 1 hour mute.
2.4.1 - nicknames. Your discord nickname should be deemed ‘safe for work’, and if not can be changed by a staff member. The use of real world figures in your discord nickname is also banned, along with political slogans, and anything to do with religion. This is to cause as little offence and arguments as possible.
2.4.2 - you may not use your nickname to impersonate staff or other server members.
2.5 - AFK’ing. Being AFK for over 30 minutes will lead to an auto-kick
2.6 - advertisement. Advertising over DM’s is not allowed, and if reported may lead to a temp. mute. Advertising is only allowed in the self-advertisement channel.
2.7 - selling items for real world money is not allowed under Mojang's EULA, and will result in a permanent ban for both participants.
2.8 - links. Sending malicious or NSFW links, such as ip-grabbers, adult film sights, or viruses will result in a mute. Sending shorthand links will also result in a mute due to us not knowing what it is.
2.9 - E-dating and non-server related roleplay should not be discussed in public chats - keep that to DM’s. not following this may result in a mute. (note that roleplay from in-game events is allowed).
2.10 - any other forms of breaking Mojang or Discords TOS will result in punishment. Please notify an admin through a support ticket if you know of anyone violating these, or any of the other rules.
 
## Griefing and wars (Towny)
3.1 - griefing across the inside of claims or on roads/ railroads will result in a 10d ban for all participants of the grief. Griefing can include, but is not limited to the following actions:
Breaking or exploding blocks around a claim that cause mass damage
Destroying the tracks or building blocks of a highway/ railroad
Destruction of trees or natural resources outside of a claimed city.
3.2 - the theft of items from chests or any other form of storage inside a claim is banned, even if the town has the permissions for opening chests set for everyone. Failure to meet this will result in a 3-7d ban
3.3 - war is declared using towny, a statement in PM’s or with /w, and with a signed book, and has to be done by proper authority (Town mayors or nation owners). War ends when a side declares defeat. (For more info on Towny wars and how they work, visit https://minecraftwar.fandom.com/wiki/Towny)
3.4 - destroying land in ‘wilderness’. Towny considers unclaimed land wilderness, which means that the destruction and griefing of land there is allowed, however stealing is only allowed in abandoned structures, and not unclaimed parts of a town.
3.5 - TP trapping. Tp trapping is where a person pretends to be giving away items, and then kills people when they tp to them. Please report any incidents of this to an admin/ mod and they will look through the situation and decide on a punishment
3.6 - killing outside of war. The murder of other players is allowed, however may receive negative reactions from other players. However killing someone and taking their items will fall under stealing, and will result in a 24h ban. Remember admins can enter and alter your inventory and echest. [as of 23rd march 2021] However in war you can kill and not have to return items.

## Claiming a town
4.1.1 - towny commands and towny. claims are all made through the plugin ‘Towny’, which regulates the amount of land your town can own. This is through your player count and Towny balance. To make a new town you use the command ‘/town new {townname}’ with townname being what you wish to call your town. To set the town warp point, use ‘/town set spawn’ (note this has to be done by a town mayor)
4.1.2 - when expanding a town claim, the new towny block (chunk) needs to be touching an already existing part of the town, unless it is an outpost, (a disconnected part which requires you to pay for the expansion). To add another chunk you use the command ‘/town claim’.
4.1.3 - to add someone to your town, a mayor can run the command ‘/town add {playername}’, or can make their town joinable by anyone with the command ‘/toggle town open’, allowing a player to use /town join {townname} to join an open town.
4.2 - towny claims cannot involve panhandles that are used to cut off a towns expansion, any claims like this will be liquidated by an admin. However a claim along a peninsula is allowed as no one will be claiming around it, or if the panhandle has a practical use i.e. a runway.
4.3 - towns made only to cut off another towns expansion will be removed by an admin.
4.4 - a town must be named after an existing or historic town/ city, and made in the same place, however a nation can bear a made-up name. A town must also be in the same general area as its real-life counterpart is/ was.
4.5 - towns or nations with similar names are not allowed to avoid confusion and the newest ones leader will be asked to rename it.
4.6 - claims that are made that involve an end portal or any other structures that should be public will be removed by an admin. (these include, but are not limited to portals, historic ruins, war sites, and the ocean)

5.3 - to open a support ticket, join the discord at https://discord.gg/vU3MPdXVqz , then message the bot ‘ModMail’ over DM’s. This will allow you to open a ticket that an admin will get back to as soon as possible. (if you need more help, watch this video on how it works https://youtu.be/U0Oo-dYyCNA)
